I am sorry.  

I've made a habit of making terrible, unthinking and emotional decisions in my life.  At what point do my actions go beyond those I resented of my family when I was young?  Weaponizing some dusty old rhetoric to bully others is a terrble and irresponsible example to set and I regret acting so selfishly.  I won't blame culture or politics, only I am to blame and this dissatisfaction and meanness that threatens to ruin the rest of my life.
